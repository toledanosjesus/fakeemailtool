Fake Email Tool

To use this tool you just need to modify the variables below with your own connection details:

$PSEmailServer = "Your_email_server_address"     # Please, modify this variable
$SMTPPort = "Your_email_server_Port"             # Please, modify this variable
$SMTPUsername = "Your_email_server_username"     # Please, modify this variable
$Password = "Your_email_server_password"         # Please, modify this variable

If you do not own a server, you can use a free service like smtp2go.com
