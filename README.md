# fakeemailtool

To customize this tool you just need to modify the variables below with your own connection details:

    $PSEmailServer = "Your_email_server_address"     # Please, modify this variable
    $SMTPPort = "Your_email_server_Port"             # Please, modify this variable
    $SMTPUsername = "Your_email_server_username"     # Please, modify this variable
    $Password = "Your_email_server_password"         # Please, modify this variable

If you do not own a server, you can use a free service like https://smtp2go.com

After this, you can simply convert it to an exe file:
- Download PS2EXE from Microsoft: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5
- Unzip the file
- Execute Win-PS2EXE.exe
- Fill the form with your details
- Enjoy the tool

If you just want to test it quickly, you can use FakeEmailTool.exe that has a limit of 25 emails per hour.
